        //refer to the same variable later on.
        //we assign a variable with an "=" we call this an assignment 
        //operator. then after that the 0 is what we are storing in the
        //variable. finally a semicolon to tell the computer we are done with 
        //our statement.

        //use this area to try and play around with integers.
        //assign a new variable for x and y then output the area of
        //the square those two sides would make.
